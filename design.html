		<p> For this website, we chose colours that stand behind our brand meaning, which is about women empowerment and speaking your mind as a women. Since the typical colours described for women are mainly pink-ish colours and red overtones, we chose these two colours as a base to build an aesthetic that might seem as stereotypical and an acknowledged colour palette by women; but women speaking their minds are fighting this. Pink and red stand for being strong, feeling empowered and being proud of your gender. A creative outlet.
		<img src="images/merc.jpg" alt="women" width="500px" class="center"> 
			Most of the women portrayed in any promotional pictures on this website are diverse and fighting those stereotypes, women of different colours, different skintypes and hairstyles. But still <b>powerful</b> women. </p>
		<p>Red and Pink are mainly used within promotional pictures, the website style and logo-wise. And although our brand vision involves women empowerment, it is not only for that purpose. It is about sexuality empowerment, gender empowerment and all these different lifestyles that bring women together to create. We used soft pastel colours for the background and tried a <b>minimal</b> style for a peaceful and relaxing feeling. We do not want our audience to feel stressed or uncomfortable, this is a safe space created for our audience to express themselves in any way they feel comfortable to do so.</p>	  </div>
