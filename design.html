		<p> The visual identity of our brand embraces the concepts of femininity, power and expression. Our colour palette, typography and overall website design all align with our young, creative female target audience and the brand identity outlined in our Brand Road Map.<br>
		<h4><b><center>COLOUR PALETTE</center></b></h4>
					<img src="images/colorcode.png" class="embed-responsive" alt="color code">
		We selected a colour palette that stands behind our brand meaning, which is about female empowerment and speaking your mind/self-expression. Since the standard colours assigned to women are often pink-ish colours and red overtones, we chose these two colours as a base to build an aesthetic that might seem as stereotypical and an acknowledged colour palette by women; but women speaking their minds are fighting this. In our brand context, pink and red stand for being strong, feeling empowered and being proud of your gender. A creative outlet.
			For the visual aesthetic of our website, we chose to use very bright, lively and enthusiastic women. Most of the women portrayed in the promotional pictures on this website are diverse and fighting those stereotypes, women of different colour, different skintypes and hairstyles. But still <b>powerful</b> women, nonetheless. </p>
		<p>To maintain consistency across all platforms, red and pink are mainly used within promotional pictures, the website style and logo-wise. And although our brand vision involves women empowerment, it is not only for that purpose. It is about sexuality empowerment, gender empowerment and all these different lifestyles that bring women together to create. We used soft pastel colours for the background and tried a <b>minimal</b> style for a peaceful and relaxing feeling. We do not want our audience to feel stressed or uncomfortable, this is a safe space created for our audience to express themselves in any way they feel comfortable to do so.</p>	  </div>

				<h4><b><center>TYPOGRAPHY</center></b></h4><p>
 "Gill Sans", "Gill Sans MT", "Myriad Pro", "DejaVu Sans Condensed", Helvetica, Arial, "sans-serif", <b>Montserrat Extra Bold, Montserrat Extra Light.</b> ‘Montserrat Extra Light’ and ‘Arial Black’ are our two main fonts for the website. We opted for a very minimalistic typography so that the design of the text does not distract from the rest of the content. The thick, boldness of the Arial Black compliments the subtle, thin lines of the Montserrat which creates a sense of visual harmony. </p>
							<h4><b><center>LINE AND SPACE</center></b></h4><p>
		Since we use a lot of imagery and photos on our website, we wanted the line and space of the website to remain simplistic. This way there is a visual balance between the busy photos and calm background. Each photo on the website is a geometric square shape and our website is filled with many straight lines and sharp corners. As mentioned previously, the photos and colours on our website are already quite dominant and we did not want to make the website too visually chaotic/busy with additional shapes or squiggly lines. </p>

				<h4><b><center>DESIGNING WIREFRAMES</center></b></h4>
<p>The images on the left are the wireframes we designed digitally for the website. We also did a wireframe-walkthrough to test the usability and accessibility of the website.</p><br>
			<h4><b><center>USER-TESTING</center></b></h4>
		<p> For this particular part we made use of a survey, which we sent out to 8 people who were then assigned to go through the website and click on multiple options, to give us constructive feedback in the survey (linked
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUKoEVHVmXiJeJJE3LbmfWo38u8fCYSIc7dOdRPsKWcZPHBQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>). We made use of this because it is important to get feedback from different people and to learn from their first impressions so that we can make changes to the website if needed.</p>
		<p><b>These are some quotes from our Survey participants:</b><i>“Very nice font combination, I like the color palette as well! One minor thing, the photo on the bookings page is higher up than the text (not aligned), which isn't super bothering.”</i><br><br>
<i>“The meet the team segment seems too big and more information about the team would be nice, such as role, age, job etc. The form underneath seems disjointed and crooked”</i><br><br>
<i>“When you open a new page you’re able to slide to left and right while there is no content there. It’s better to have static pages where you can only swipe up or down and zoom in.”</i><br><br>

			<b>Recommendations for improvements based on user testing:</b><br>
We created a list of concrete changes we needed to make to the Website to fulfill the feedback from our user-testing survey:
<ul>
  <li>Align the position of the image on the Bookings page with the form and make the image responsive
</li>
  <li>Meet-the-team image on the Community page is not responsive
</li>
  <li>Straighten out the form on the Community page (make them align with each other)
</li>
	<li>Check the responsiveness of images on the Mobile device
</li>
	<li>For future reference, we could add Testimonials from customers as stated by participant #7
</li>
</ul>
		</p>
	  <p>In conclusion, we revised our website according to the feedback we received during User-testing, this way we are able to optimize the usability of our website.</p>
